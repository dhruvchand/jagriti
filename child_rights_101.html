                <h4 class="big">Definition of a Child</h4>
                <p>The child has been defined as a person not having completed 18 years of age. <br/>
                Children can be divided into three age groups:<br/>
                      <ul>
                          <li>Younger children(5-12 years)</li>
                          <li>Children(13-14 years)</li>
                          <li>Adolescents(15-18 years)</li>
                      </ul>
                </p>

                <h4 class="big">What is child abuse?</h5>
                <p>A universal definition for child abuse does not exist as of now. But according to WHO child abuse can be categorized as follows.</p>

                <h5 class="big">Physical Abuse</h5>
                <p>Physical Abuse is the act of imposing physical injury upon a child. This may include burning, hitting, punching, shaking, kicking, beating or otherwise harming a child.
                </p>

                <h5 class="big">Sexual Abuse: </h5>
                <p>Sexual Abuse is inappropriate sexual behaviour with a child.
                It includes :</p>
                <table style="border:none;">
                      <tr>
                          <td>Fondling a child&#39;s genitals</td>
                          <td>Rape</td>
                      </tr>
                      <tr>
                          <td>Making an adult fondle the child&#39;s genitals </td>
                          <td>Sodomy</td></tr>
                      <tr>
                          <td>Intercourse</td>
                          <td>Exhibitionism</td></tr>
                      <tr>
                          <td>Incest</td>
                          <td>Sexual exploitation</td></tr>
                </table>
                <p>To be considered &#39;child abuse&#39;, these acts have to be committed by a person responsible for the care of a child (for example a babysitter, a parent, or a day care provider), or related to the child. If a stranger commits these acts, it would be considered sexual assault and handled by the police and the criminal courts.</p>

                <h5 class="big">Emotional Abuse: </h5>
                <p>Emotional Abuse is also known as verbal abuse, mental abuse, and psychological maltreatment. <br/>
                It includes acts by parents or caretakers, or their failure to act, that have caused  or could cause serious</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>behavioural, </li>
                  <li>cognitive, </li>
                  <li>emotional, or </li>
                  <li>mental trauma</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                This can include parents/caretakers using extreme and/or bizarre forms of punishment, such as confinement in a closet or dark room or being tied to a chair for long periods of time or threatening or terrorizing a child.
                </p>

                <h5 class="big">Neglect</h5>
                <p>
                    It is the failure to provide for the child&#39;s basic needs. <br/>
                Neglect can be physical, educational, or emotional.
                <br/>
                <b>Physical Neglect:</b> Physical neglect can include not providing adequate food or clothing, appropriate medical care, supervision, or proper weather protection (heat or cold). It may include abandonment.
                <br/>
                <b>Educational Neglect: </b>Educational neglect includes failure to provide appropriate schooling or special educational needs, allowing excessive truancies.
                <br/>
                <b>Emotional/Psychological neglect:</b> Psychological neglect includes the lack of any emotional support and love, never attending to the child, substance abuse including allowing the child to participate in drug and alcohol use.
                </p>
                <br/><br/>
                <h4 class="big">Rights of Children</h4>
                <p><b>Right to procreation of children: </b>One of the primary end of marriage is procreation of children. In India right to marry is the prerogative of the women. Breach of age restriction does not render the marriage void. The right to conceive cannot be interfered with. The family planning rules are advisory and not obligatory. Termination of pregnancy is restricted under 312 IPC and MTP act 1971. In India, minors&#39; consent is a necessity for abortion. </p>
                <br/>
                <h4 class="big">Right of the Unborn Child:</h4>
                <p>Under IPC, killing of a child is recognised as an offence. A woman who is quick with her child cannot opt for abortion. Killing of a foetus is an offence if it does not come under the exception.</p>
                <br/>
                <h4 class="big">Equality Rights and Protection for foetus</h4>
                <p>Under Art.14 and 21 equal rights and protection shall be accorded to foetuses as well. Section 20 of Succession Act provides for equal share for the child in the property if it was in the womb of the mother at the time of the death of the testator.</p>
                <br/>
                <h4 class="big">Human Rights and child</h4>
                <p>&ldquo;Child is the National Asset&rdquo; and it is a malleable potential. The Indian Law recognises the following aspects related to the child:<br/>
                    <ol>
                        <li>PNDT act (1994) prohibits sex determination.</li>
                        <li>In the case legitimacy and paternity of the children, burden of proof will be always on the one who challenges presumption.</li>
                        <li>Sale of babies is illegal.</li>
                        <li>No corporal punishments for a child as guaranteed under Art.21</li>
                        <li>Children are considered as victims of crime in the following cases:
                            <ul>
                              <li>Economic exploitation (child labour)</li>
                              <li>Sexual abuse</li>
                              <li>Drafted for war.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
                <br/>
                <h4 class="big">Child Marriages</h4>
                <p>Child Marriage Restraint Act prohibits child marriage. However any such marriage within the prohibited age limit does not become void for the reason that the child should not suffer from such extreme measure. Benefits for the children are provided, but punishment for the parents are adequately provided.</p>
                <br/>
                <h4 class="big">Child Prostitution</h4>
                <p>Prevention of Immoral Traffic Act-1956 not only provides for prohibition of child prostitution but equally lays stress on rehabilitation and succour.</p>
                <br/>
                <h4 class="big">Child Exploitation</h4>
                <p>
                Begging and forced labour etc are only a tip of the iceberg of varieties of child exploitation. Both National and State legislations provide for prevention of various kinds of exploitation.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <h4 class="big">Child Labour</h4>
                <p>Child Labour is a socio-legal issue where total prohibition measures sometimes are counterproductive. The causes for child labour are:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Poverty</li>
                    <li>Low wages</li>
                    <li>Unemployment</li>
                    <li>No family allowances</li>
                    <li>Migration to urban areas</li>
                    <li>Large families</li>
                    <li>Cheap child labour</li>
                    <li>Lack of education</li>
                    <li>Illiteracy and ignorance</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Child Labour Prohibition and Regulation Act 1986 provides for payment of compensation of &#8377;20,000 by the offending employer which shall be deposited in the Child Rehabilitation Centre Welfare Fund.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <h4 class="big">Right to Adoption</h4>
                <p>Adoption is the transfer of parental responsibilities to another person legally. It involves rights and responsibilities including restrictions to the adopting parents in order to protect the child.</p>
                <br/>
                <h4 class="big">Human Rights and Juveniles</h4>
                <p>Juvenile justice (Care and Protection) Act 2000: Under the Act, a Juvenile is a person who has not attained 16 years of age in case of male, and 18 years in case of female.
                Juveniles are of 2 kinds:<br/>
                a. Neglected Juveniles<br/>
                b. Delinquent Juveniles<br/>
                <br/>
                The Act provides for care, protection, treatment, development and rehabilitation of neglected or delinquent juveniles.   </p>
